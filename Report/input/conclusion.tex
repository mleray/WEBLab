\label{sec:conclusion}

Night clubs, parties, and actually any drinking with friends are good ways to have fun. However, people should drink responsibly and know their limits in the amounts of alcohol they can ingest. Beerculator could be developed further to provide a tool for people that need a simple and effective solution, for a problem that most of them are not aware of having: reckless drinking. It is important to mention that the project is not over and that it is only on its first stage, however the results have nicely surprised us because we did not expect a tool like this to be as effective as it is with such a simplicity of usage.\\

Definitely, some problems happened in the process of making this project, but through teamwork and dedication this hurdles could be surpassed. Everyone on the team had a certain goal and each one of us helped to reach that goal, we collaborated throughout the weeks that we had to make sure that no important details were missed and that deadlines would be respected. The final version provides an effective solution to the problem we decided to solve, and complies with our goals. There is room for improvement and good ideas for the future of the project, but for the time being we feel satisfied with the final version.\\
