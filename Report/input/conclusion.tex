\label{sec:conclusion}
Night Clubs, parties, drinking with friends is a good way to have fun however people that do this should drink responsibly and know their limits to the amounts of alcohol they should ingest. Beerculator can be developed further to provide this tool for people that need a simple and effective solution for a problem that most of them are not aware of having, reckless drinking. It is important to mention that the project is far from over and that it is only on its alpha stage, however the results have surprised us since we did not expect a tool like this to be as effective as it is with the simplicity of usage.\\

Definitely some problems happened in the process of making this project, but through teamwork and dedication this hurdles could be surpassed. Everyone on the team had a certain goal and each of us helped to reach that goal, we collaborated throughout the weeks that we had to make sure that important details were not missed and that deadlines would be met. The final version provides an effective solution to the problem we first set to solve and complies with our goals. There is room for improvement and good ideas for the future of the project but for the time being we feel satisfied with the final version.\\
