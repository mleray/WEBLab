Beerculator is already a very useful tool, but it could still be extended with some new functionalities. 

\paragraph{New drinks} Beerculator allows the user to choose what he has consumed among a list of predefined drinks. It would be nice for him to be able to customize the application, and more precisely it would be interesting if he could add some new drinks to the database, for example his favourite ones.
\paragraph{Mobile version} Beerculator has been coded for a desktop use, it could be interesting to make its interface responsive so that people can use it on their mobile phones. It could also become an Android application that users can download on their device and then customize.
\paragraph{Artificial Intelligence} Artificial Intelligence could be added to the Beerculator for customization of the real limits of the user, since everyone has different organisms and limits the application could ask for a real sample of your alcohol level and compare it to the averages in formulas and tailor a certain average for the user instead of using the predefined ones.
