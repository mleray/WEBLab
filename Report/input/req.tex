\section{Requirement analysis}
\label{sec:req}

Bob (made-up client for the project) consumes beers and feels the effects of alcohol in his bloodstream but does not know when to stop or if he is on a safe-to-drink amount of alcohol. Bob requires a simple interactive tool that he can use on the go to check his alcohol level without being too specific about the details.\\
  
Bob should not be the only one to access this tool. He does not need the tool to store the information about previous alcohol-level calculations, but he wants to be able to interact with the tool so it can dynamically calculate his alcohol-level. He also wants to know how long it is going to take for his body to remove all this alcohol.
