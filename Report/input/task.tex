\section{Task solving}
\label{sec:task}

After a few meetings to determine the requirements and the objectives of the project, the implementation of Beerculator has been divided into several groups of solvable tasks, as detailed in {\sc table}~\ref{table:tasks}.

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  \hline
  \textbf{Group} & \textbf{Tasks}\\ \hline
  \multirow{4}{*}{Diagrams} & UML for Java \\
    & UML for databases \\
    & Entity-relationship model \\
    & User interaction \\ \hline
  \multirow{4}{*}{Databases} & Create tables \\
    & Create methods \\
    & Create relations \\ 
    & Create script \\ \hline
  \multirow{2}{*}{Server} & Define Java server \\
    & Create JSF files \\
 \hline
    Design & User interface\\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Solvable tasks for the implementation of Beerculator}
\label{table:tasks}
\end{table}


Some other tasks have been completed in parallel for the project, but are not referenced in {\sc table}~\ref{table:tasks} because they are not directly linked to the development of Beerculator. For example, the writing of the final report and the preparation for the oral evaluation were also part of this web-based project.
