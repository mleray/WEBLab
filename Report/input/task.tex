\section{Solvable tasks and team management}
\label{sec:task}

After a few meetings to determine the requirements and the objectives of the project, the implementation of Beerculator has been divided into several groups of solvable tasks, as detailed in {\sc table}~\ref{table:tasks}.

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  \hline
  \textbf{Group} & \textbf{Tasks}\\ \hline
  \multirow{3}{*}{Diagrams} & UML for Java \\
    & UML for databases \\
    & User interaction \\ \hline
  \multirow{4}{*}{Databases} & Create tables \\
    & Set up methods \\
    & Define relations \\ 
    & Write script \\ \hline
  \multirow{2}{*}{Server} & Define Java server \\
    & Create Java beans \\
 \hline
    \multirow{2}{*}{Calculation} & Find formulas \\
    & Implement them \\ \hline
    Design & User interface\\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

\label{table:tasks}
\end{table}


Some other tasks have been completed in parallel for the project, but are not referenced in {\sc table}~\ref{table:tasks} because they are not directly linked to the development of Beerculator. For example, writing the final report was also part of this web-based project, and every member of the team contributed to it.\\


We often worked all together and we had very regular meetings, so everyone was always aware of the state of the project and of the remaining work. And of course if anyone had a problem on its task, we helped each other so we all contributed to the whole project. But in general, each group of tasks in {\sc table}~\ref{table:tasks} had a \guillemotleft{} manager \guillemotright{} and the distribution was the following:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item {\bf Alvaro}: Diagrams;
\item {\bf Maud}: Calculation;
\item {\bf Patricio}: Server;
\item {\bf Tom√°s}: Databases.
\end{itemize}

The last group, Design, is not in the previous list because it had no real responsible, everybody in the team equally contributed to it.
