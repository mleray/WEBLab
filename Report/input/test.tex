\section{Testing instructions}
\label{sec:test}

When you get to Beerculator's web page, the first thing to do is to enter your personal informations. To do so, in the \guillemotleft{} User data \guillemotright{} tab, you have to indicate your weight in kilogramms and then your gender (Male/Female). You should also indicate what time you started drinking (for example, 8pm). If one of these is missing, Beerculator will not be able to perform the calculation. Once you are done here, you should click on the \guillemotleft{} Save \guillemotright{} button.\\

After that, you can move on to the right side of the screen and start adding drinks to your list. To do so, you have to click on the green squares corresponding to the drinks you have had. If you made a mistake, for instance if you added the wrong drink, you can always click on the associated red square in order to cancel and remove this drink. Then, to be sure not to loose your list, you should click on the \guillemotleft{} Save \guillemotright{} button.\\

Finally, you can launch the computation thanks to the \guillemotleft{} Calculation \guillemotright{} tab. The BAC value is indicated in the first text block, and it is followed by the time (in hours) that you have to wait before being sober again.
