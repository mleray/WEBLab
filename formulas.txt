BEERCULATOR -> Calculate blood alcohol level according to the amount of beer, and the time it will take to disappear

=> Formulas

- Widmark formula : EBAC = (0.806 * SD *1.2)/(BW * Wt) - (MR * DP)
where 0.806 is a constant for body water in the blood (mean 80.6%), SD is the number of standard drinks containing 17 grams of ethanol, 
1.2 is a factor to convert the amount in grams to Swedish standards set by The Swedish National Institute of Public Health, 
BW is a body water constant (0.58 for men and 0.49 for women), Wt is body weight (kilogram), MR is the metabolism constant (0.017) 
and DP is the drinking period in hours.

- Simplified Widmark formula : BAC = [Alcohol consumed in grams / (Body weight in grams x r)] x 100. 
In this formula, “r” is the gender constant: r = 0.55 for females and 0.68 for males.

- BAC% = (A × 5.14/W × r) - .015 × H
where:
   A: Total alcohol consumed, in ounces (oz)
   W: Body weight, in pounds (lbs)
   r: The alcohol distribution ratio, 0.73 for man, and 0.66 for women
   H: Time passed since drinking, in hours

=> Needed info :

- Gender
- Weight
- Nb of hours since the drinking began
- Amount of beer (with an average alcohol degree: 5%) 

----------

Widmark Formula:

- C = A / (M * R) 

	C: Blood Alcohol level
	A: Grams of alcohol ingested
	R: Ratio - 0.70 for man 
		 - 0.55 for women
	M: Body weight, in kg

--- How to calculate A?

A = (V * P * 0.8) / 100

	V: Volume of alcohol in c.c
	P: Alcohol degree 
	
Elimination of alcohol :

- The median rate of decrease in BAC is considered to be 15 milligrams per cent (mg%) per hour.
